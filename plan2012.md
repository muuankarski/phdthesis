Research plan for years 2012-2013
=================================

I will be very briefly here and only describe the current projects I’m
working with and my plans for the dissertation articles and for
implementation.

### Ongoing projects

At the time of writing this paper I’m working on two other paper. First
one is a joint article with prof. Mikko Niemelä titled *Attributions for
Poverty in East Central European Countries* where we are studying public
perceptions of the causes of poverty in East Central European countries.
Paper examines cross-country differences in attributions for poverty and
explores whether different lay explanations of poverty can be attributed
to specific socio-demographic characteristics, ethnicity, economic
circumstances and wider values and attitudes, such as generalised trust
as well as attitudes towards the role of government and democracy. Our
follow-up dataset focuses on (the effects of) financial crisis and
therefore a special emphasis is given to public perceptions of the
financial crisis and its association with attributions for poverty. I’m
not certain if I will include this article in my dissertation, probably
not, but we are working hard to have this submitted in next two months.

The second project is a book in Finnish titled "Eurooppalaiset elinolot"
that is run by the research department of Kela and studies the counter
play of various "transitions" (eg. retirement, unemployment, child
birth) in life cycles and welfare state.

Lately I have also been writing and analysing background material for
Aleksanteri institute Centre of Excellence (CoE) project.

### Dissertation topic

I redrafted the working title of my work for this paper as: *Poverty,
place and income redistribution - Analysis of poverty dynamics and
welfare state development in post-socialist transition*. As it became
clear in the first chapter I will put more emphasis in my analysis on
the spatial dimension of poverty that i originally planned. I also
raised the welfare state development to title, as due to simultaneity of
CeO-project I will work with that discussion a lot and want to
incorporate it with my work. The geographical focus remains the same and
I will study Russia in one or two of the article for the same reason,
though it was my idea in first place. As for the welfare policies I will
focus on income redistribution, namely the social cash benefits.

With poverty dynamics I’m referring to both temporal and spatial
variation in poverty. In poverty research, poverty dynamics are often
discussed through questions like: How likely are people to enter, exit,
and re-enter poverty? How long do people remain in poverty? And what
events are associated with entering and exiting poverty? These question
from one US analysis refer to poverty as a temporally varying phenomenon
which I will discuss in one of my articles, most probably the other one
on Russia.

Research Design
---------------

Here I will introduce the current ideas I have on the topic of my
articles. They are mostly already bit more than ideas, but none of them
is near to submission.

### Article 1 - (Non-Spatial) Social Policies and Regional Income Inequality in Poland and Hungary in 1986 - 2009

A quick abstract for this one:

> This paper utilizes both micro- and microlevel data to assess the role
> of social policies in growth of regional income inequalities during
> post-socialist transition from 1986 to 2009 in Hungary and Poland. A
> decomposition of certain inequality measures (gini, Theill) allows to
> estimate role of different income sources with the respect to increase
> in regional income inequality during transition period.

I’m currently working with the data to find out what actually can be
conducted and what cannot. This has been frozen since mid December, but
is soon melting. Here are just few graphs from preliminary analysis
based on recent data.

### Article 2 - Social cash benefits and poverty spells in post-soviet Russia

A panel data assessment of entering, exiting and re-entering to poverty
during transition using Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey.

### Article 3 - Targeting of social cash benefits for materially deprived in Enlarged EU

A study of how socially targeted policies correspond with poverty
measured as material deprivation.

### Article 4 - Something about Russian regions and welfare state modernisation

Implementation
--------------

I’m running late from my original plan of implementation that is
presented on page two. In term of published articles. The main reason
has been that I haven’t been clear of my corner of sandbox and haven’t
managed take any of the ideas to the submitting phase. I’m trying to
catch up during coming two years.

[^1]: At-risk-of-poverty rate can be also translated as a measure of
    income inequality among the poorer half of a country’s citizens. It
    is not sensitive to changes in income inequality happening in the
    wealthier half of population.
