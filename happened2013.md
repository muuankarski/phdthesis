## 1. Attributions for Poverty in European Post Socialist Countries

- keywords: post-socialist space, attributions for poverty, multilevel modelling, attitudes

*Utilising The Life in Transition Survey (LiTS) conducted in 2010, the purpose of the paper is to examine public perceptions of the causes of poverty in Europe and West- ern Asia with special emphasis on post-socialist countries. The study applies multi- level techniques in order to analyse the role of individual and country-level explanatory factors as determinants of poverty attributions. As country-level determinants, paper analyses the changes in country’s economic performance during the period of global financial crises, income inequality and the state of democracy. As individual-level determinants, the paper tests to what extent risk factors related to financial hardship are associated with perceptions of the causes of poverty.*

## 2. European regimes of material deprivation

- keywords: EU, EU-silc, material deprivation, decomposition analysis, regimesof material deprivation

*This article poses a question to what extend European nations group or differ with regard to level of overall  material deprivation and it's components. Material deprivation was recently promoted as an equally important component with income poverty and low work intensity to form a new poverty measure of the EU2020 strategy. It adds an absolute component to traditionally relative measure of European poverty in order to capture the differences in the (real) living standards of EU citizens in wealthier and poorer countries. Material poverty draws a very different picture of the European poverty correlates with the real income levels and economic performance of countries. This paper breaks the indicator down to individual items and takes a cross-national and longitudinal look into evolution of the items using demoposition analysis.*

## 3. WHO GETS WHAT - AND WHERE: Regional poverty outcomes of social assistance in enlarged EU: The case of Poland and Austria 

- keywords: EU, territorial level analysis, place based poverty

*Since 1989, the divide between Europe's East and West has been evident in terms of poverty and social and economical inequality. Over the transition period the between-nation inequalities have declined in the enlarged EU, while the regional inequalities have increased within most of the countries, especially within European post-socialist countries. As a result most of the economic inequalities today in enlarged EU are already inequalities within nations. An evident outcome of these increasing regional disparities is that poverty is becoming more and more rooted in place. This seminar paper approaches poverty outcomes of social assistance from regional perspective. It addresses the question, to what extend socially targeted benefits can alleviate poverty that varies spatially. Preliminary analysis are conducted on social assistance benefits using EU2020 poverty indicators and 2008 EU-silc data from Poland and Austria.*

## 5. Geographies of material deprivation/energy poverty in Russia

* keywords: spatial analysis, poverty mapping, material deprivation, multidimensional poverty, place

*A spatial assesment of geographies of material deprivation in selected Russian regions, Karelia being one of them. Analysis based on 2010 census data that provides information on household material living conditions down to communities size of 5 individuals. This data on living conditions will be analysed in geographical reference system allowing spatial modelling and linking with other sources of place based data. Open census data is an unique resources for such analysis. Paper may be linked with Russian energy research active here at the Aleksanteri institute through recent some recent new index as [Measuring energy poverty: Focusing on what matters](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032111003972)*
